# Drearypill Designs

## Description Deliverable

## Elevator Pitch

I love clothes and designing clothes and have been wanting to make a website to sell clothes for a while. I have been thinking that to start I will just create desgins that I can send to Printful similar to the Etsy shop I have now but I can create my own unique websites to directly sell from instead of using a third party. My website will be similar to an Etsy shop but with my own twist and the ability to like products or contact me directly with questions

## Key Features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Display product categories
- Ability to search products
- Ability to add items to cart or wishlist
- Persistently store user logged in, items in cart, items added to wishlist

## Technologies
I am going to use the technologes in the following ways

- HTML: Correct HTML structure for applications. Types of pages will be Home, Login/create account, Product Page, Wishlist/liked, and Cart/checkout
- CSS: Used for styling that looks good on different creen sizes and good use of space and colors
- Javascript: Provides login, adding items to cart and wishlist, backend endpoint calls
- Service: Backend service with endpoints for login, adding to cart and wishlist, and retrieveing cart and wishlist status
- DB: Store users, wishlist, and cart in database.
- Login: Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't checkout unless authenticated.
- WebSocket: As each user adds to cart, their cart is updated and can be viewed upon selection
- React: Application ported to use the React web framework.
